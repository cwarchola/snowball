#This project was absolutely nerve-racking. What I thought was a toothache is probably TMJ (stress).
#I needed a little help with making sure that every file necessary was uploaded to Github.
#I asked my son for help because I knew that Prof. Rosen and the TAs would be severely overworked.
#I really did enjoy writing this program and it made me laugh.
#Laughter was the thing that got me through.
#I can't wait to make this program what I REALLY want it to be.
#It would have been severely late had I tried; the data I would need comes from websites
#that use legacy programming. Well, I guess I'm going to be learning another programming language (or two).
